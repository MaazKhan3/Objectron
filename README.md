![Object Detection](https://github.com/MaazKhan3/Objectron/assets/banner.png)  
*A Python-based object detection project with an interactive UI.*

## Overview

**Objectron** is a Python project that utilizes pre-trained models to detect objects such as **cups, shoes, and cameras.** It features a **user-friendly interface** built using `pygame`, allowing seamless navigation and object selection. The project aims to provide an easy-to-use solution for object detection with plans for future customization.
